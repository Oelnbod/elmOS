# ElmOS ![elmo](elmo.png)

If you want to break things, just git clone and run change-elmo.sh as root.
Don't ask why this exists.
Please don't use on someone without trying it first on a vm or live image.

There is also a colour swapped Elmo that I think looks quite nice on the dock in gnome instead of the launch apps icon. To change it, just replace /usr/share/icons/Yaru/scalable/actions/view-app-grid-ubiquity-symbolic.svg with your elmo whilst keeping the same file name. 

I believe that the original image came from: https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/793312480/ , but I am unable to determine copyright, as I get an error with this image is not available. If you are the original author, please contact me.
